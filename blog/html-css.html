      <p>What is the difference between <span style ="color:rgb(229, 149, 70)"> Margin, Border and Padding?</span></p>
      <p>Margin, border and padding are important components for how a webpage looks.</p>
      <p>In order to understand this, itâ€™s important to know that a webpage is made up of elements that help structure and section the webpage. </p>
      <p>Margin, Border and Padding are essential in helping style these elements and we do this by treating elements like boxes where there is a top, bottom, left and right. </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      Margin: When setting the margin for an element, we are changing the space around each element in our webpage. Another way of thinking about it is changing how close two boxes are. 
      </li>
      <li>
      Border: When changing the border, we are changing the outline of the element. Making changes to the border includes how thick you want the border to be, making the corners of the box rounder, or even changing its colour.    
      </li>
      <li>
        Padding is the space around the content of an element that has a defined border. Another way to imagine this is like you being in the middle of the swimming pool and changing the distance between you and the edge of the pool by adding more space.    
      </li>
      </ul>
