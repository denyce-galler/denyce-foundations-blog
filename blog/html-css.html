        <p>What is the difference between <span style ="color:#cdb38b"> Margin, Border and Padding?</span></p>
        <p>Margin, border and padding are important components to how a webpage looks.</p>
        <p>In order to understand this, itâ€™s important to know that a webpage is made up of elements that help structure and section it! </p>
        <p>Margin, Border and Padding are essential in helping style these elements. To design it, we treat the elements like boxes where there is a top, bottom, left and right sides and we change them by adding a number value and px next to it which stands for pixels. </p>
        <p>Let's take a look at the screenshot which is what is styling this element, or 'blue box' that this text is sitting in right now! </p> 
        <p>As you can see I have set my margin, padding and border. The green values are next to each other because from left to right are the values of each side of the element. The first value is the top of the element or 'box', and moving clockwise you have the last value being the right side of the element.</p>

        <span style ="color:#cdb38b"> Margin</span>: When setting the margin for an element, we are changing the space around each element in our webpage. Another way of thinking about it is changing how close two boxes are from each other. So in this webpage for example, this is how far this 'blue box' is from the edge of the orange 'Technical blogpost' heading. 
       </p>
       <p>
        <span style ="color:#cdb38b"> Border</span>: When changing the border, we are changing the outline of the element. Making changes to the border includes how thick you want the border to be, making the corners of the box rounder, or even changing its colour. From the screenshot, I set a border-radius, which is what is making the corners of this element round.    
       </p>
       <p>
        <span style ="color:#cdb38b"> Padding</span>: is the space around the content of an element that has a defined border. Another way to imagine this is like you being in the middle of the swimming pool and changing the distance between you and the edge of the pool by adding more or less distance. In this webpage, an example is how far the text is from the edge of the 'box' that it's in.
