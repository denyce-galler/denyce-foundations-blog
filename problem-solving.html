           Were blocked on a simple problem
        </p>
        <p>
          - What was the problem? - 
        </p>
        <p> While completing the built-in section methods where we were tasked to capitalize a string, 
          I was struggling with being able to console log the entire function 
        </p>
        <p>
          - What problem-solving techniques did you use? - 
        </p> 
        <p>
          I explained out loud what each section, also looking back at the task that was instructed to us, only to realise that I did not return a variable  
        </p> 
        <p>
         - How did you feel throughout the process? - 
        </p> 
        <p>
          Frustrated and confused why it wasn’t working
        </p> 
        <p>
         - What did you learn? - 
        </p> 
        <p>
          Breaking down the problem is useful and also making sure that I read carefully and keep reminding myself of what the task is

        <p>
         - How did you feel throughout the process? -
        </p> 
        <p>
          I felt quite challenged but optimistic that I can complete it  
        </p> 
        <p>
         - What did you learn? -
        </p> 
        <p>
          I learned how to properly use the one line arrow

         Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:
        </p> 
        <p>
         Pseudocode - I feel confident using this technique and I find it quite helpful
        </p> 
        <p>
         Trying something - I feel confident using this technique
        </p> 
        <p>
         Rubber ducky method - I feel confident using this technique but often forget to use it  
        </p> 
        <p>
         Reading error messages - Slowly gaining confidence. I sometimes find it hard reading the error its pointing out 
        </p> 
        <p>
         Console.logging - I feel confident using this technique and find it helpful to see if a part of code works  
        </p> 
        <p>
         Googling - I feel confident using this technique but sometimes there are sources that have explanations that are hard to understand. I find watching videos much more helpful
        </p>
        <p>
         Asking your peers for help - I feel confident doing this and this is my go-to technique most times 
        </p>  
        <p>
         Asking coaches for help - I feel confident doing this but don’t do it directly as much as I would ask in a channel where other students also help 
        </p>  
        <p>
         Improving your process with reflection - I feel confident doing this especially with how much reflection is completed in foundations  
         </p>  
      </div>
      <div class="answers">
        <p class="prompt">
         - Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. -
        </p> 
        <p>
          I was reluctant to ask for help because there was already an explanation provided by someone for the same problem. Their explanation helped others but I actually couldn’t properly understand it. I think I struggle with the aspect that I don’t understand it but others can.
