          A strength I pointed out in my foundations learning plan was me losing motivation when I don’t find something interesting which I still rings true. 
          But so far, I have been really engaged and enjoying every moment of foundations. Therefore so far, I am really committed and engaged with the content and have been consistent with how much work I am putting in with the challenges. 
          I think this is a good foreshadowing with my commitment to the content in bootcamp if the content was similar.

          I will make sure that I stick to the timetable that I set for myself at the start of each week. 
          I will attend all lectures and commit myself to attending and being attentive to pair programming activities/skype calls with other students. If something comes up in my personal life where I have to take time away from bootcamp, then I will let facilitators know as soon as possible. 
          I will also make sure to attend to my mental health by going to the gym regularly.

          I really like learning and I am generally quite a curious person. So learning something new is exciting to me.  
          This paired with me being passionate with the content, means I am more engaged and committed to doing any work that may come with it.
          This also means If I don't particularly find the content interesting, it does make it difficult for me to stay on top of it or engage with the content which can limit my learning.
