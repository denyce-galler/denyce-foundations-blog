          I really like learning and I am generally quite a curious person. So learning something new is exciting to me.  
          This paired with me being passionate with the content, means I am more engaged and committed to doing any work that may come with it.
          This also means If I don't particularly find the content interesting, it does make it difficult for me to stay on top of it or engage with the content which can limit my learning.
