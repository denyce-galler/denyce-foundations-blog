       <p class="prompt">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</p>
       <p class="answers">
         One, I still struggle being able to ask for help. Even though I have managed to find the solution – it takes much longer than just actually asking and getting help then.
         Two, I find that my self-esteem is improving. I think inherently, I will always struggle with the feeling of self-doubt especially with coding. But each week where I say to myself ‘oh I actually get this’ helps diminish this feeling and builds my confidence.
          And three, I didn’t know that I can enjoy coding this much. 
       </p>

       <p class="prompt">
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
       </p>
       <p class="answers">
        I think these play a huge role in how you are able to approach learning and programming. Constantly reminding oneself of your own values definitely helps keep one grounded, 
        and this becomes important especially when things get tough which in programming, 
        I feel can happen quite a bit! Being empathetic is also important in programming because it shapes the way you interact with others. 
        I feel being able to understand how others feel especially when coming across something challenging allows sharing of struggles and can open a space where people can help each other.  
        Being self-aware is also important when it comes to learning. I think being aware of deficits when it comes to one’s knowledge is a strength because then you are able to know which area you can improve.

       <p class="prompt">
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
       </p>
       <p class="answers"> 
        I really liked knowing about neuroplasticity and growth mindset. 
        It was nice to know that anyone can enhance their knowledge and acquire new skills and that it can take just even believing yourself to make it happen.  
       </p>
    
       <p class="prompt">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
       </p>
       <p class="answers">
        I found introducing myself surprisingly hard or posting my blogposts. I think it’s because everyone can read my reflections. 
       </p>

       <p class="prompt">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
       </p>
       <p class="answers">
        I think it literally helps build good people. It helps us not only build our self-awareness but also confidence and a growth mindset. 
        I think this will become very important when it comes to going into the workforce as it will not only affect the work that we will produce eventually, but also how we are able to contribute to a positive work environment. 
       </p>

       <p class="prompt">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
       </p>
       <p class="answers">
        I definitely don’t think it’s a waste of time. I like that were not only learning about programming, but we are also taking time to improve our personalities and attitudes which I think will get us really far when it comes to not only the work we produce, but also how we interact with others within our work
