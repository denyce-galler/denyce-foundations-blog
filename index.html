      <p class="questions">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now. </p>
      <p class="answers"> 
        I had a recent instance where I worked with a colleague that had made decisions that affected the nursing care provided. I had come to realise this as I worked a lot more closely with them and it had come to the point where it was evident that it was impacting not only patient care but also the ability of the nursing team to work together. I then made the decision to bring this issue up with the team leader. Looking back I feel glad that I was virtuous in this situation as I knew that it was the right thing to do and I hope that I continue to make decisions like this when faced with the same problem.

      <p class="questions">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</p>
      <p class="answers">Values that are important to me are:</p>
        <ul class="answers">
          <li>Love</li>
          <li>Empathy</li>
        </ul>
      <p class="answers">I accredit my friends and family in helping me live these values out. They help me remind myself of how important and valuable these values can be</p>
      
      <p class="questions">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey. </p>
      <p class="answers">I would like to think I have a lot of courage and optimism when it comes to challenges. Regardless of where I am at with a task or if I am faced with a problem, I always believe that I can get through it and that I will be fine no matter what happens. I think this kind of mindset will greatly assist with my learning journey especially since I am at ground zero with my knowledge in coding. </p>
