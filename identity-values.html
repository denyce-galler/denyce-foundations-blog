            Back when I was doing Nursing, I had a colleague that had made decisions that affected the Nursing care provided. I had come to realise this as I worked a lot more closely with them and it had come to the point where I realised it had to be addressed as it impacting not only patient care but also the ability of the team to work together. I then brought this issue up with the team leader. Looking back I am glad that I chose to be virtuous in this situation

            Values that are important to me are love and empathy. I accredit my friends and family for helping me live and carry out these values because they are constant reminders as to how powerful and valuable they are.

            I would like to think I have a lot of courage and optimism when it comes to challenges. Regardless of where I am at something or what problem I am facing, I always have belief within myself that I can get through it and that I will be fine no matter what happens. I think this kind of mindset will greatly assist with my learning journey especially since I have very little knowledge about coding.

            In terms of my learning, a limitation that I have is that I lose focus if content is not interesting/something I am passionate about. I can see how this will impede my ability to hold my attention on something that is important. Same goes with my career development. If I lose passion or there aren’t areas that are interesting to me, then it can affect how I feel about moving forward in the industry.

            Nursing has given me a lot of opportunities to work with an array of patients. Therefore, i’ve experienced many instances where I am met with resistance especially from patients who refuse to work with me when carrying out their care. I find my reactions tend to be somewhat of a peace-keeper so I lean towards more of de-escalation approaches such as acting emotions displayed are intense.
