       <p class="prompt">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</p>
       <p class="answers">Being aware of neuroplasticity and its effect can help people improve skills and intelligence. It has been found that even knowing that intelligence is not a fixed trait that is inherited in childhood, 
        but actually something that is malleable and achievable in adulthood has actually improved people’s performance. </p>

       <p class="prompt">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</p>
       <p class="answers">Knowing this, it actually helps me outgrow the imposter syndrome mindset that I seem to have each week. Because I don’t have any coding background/experience, it is easy to feel like I am not at a place where some other people are at in the course. But just even knowing that having knowledge of how neuroplasticity works and how this can actually affect my performance, 
        makes me feel encouraged that I can get to a place where I will be able to feel confident coding. </p>

       <p class="prompt">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</p>
       <p class="answers">Practicing and reviewing unfamiliar content regularly. 
        Also doing simple things like imagining that I can code a concept well. </p>
    
       <p class="prompt">Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</p>
       <p class="answers"><a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ngs5_WXxfo&ab_channel=ProfCarlin%27sYoutubePage">Video on Bio Neuroplasticity and Learning</a></p>

       <p class="prompt">Research Growth Mindset - Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</p>
       <p class="answers">It is the idea that we can improve intelligence and basic qualities through personal belief and effort. It is also the idea that you can utilise criticism or feedback into motivation that you can improve. 
        This type of mindset is relevant especially for this course, as we are constantly learning new information and cultivating new skilss. </p>

       <p class="prompt">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</p>
       <p class="answers">I think through experience, I’ve always known that believing that I can do something and that I can achieve goals has always helped my mindset and outlook on difficult learning experiences, 
        but seeing that there is some evidence to support this is surprising.</p>

       <p class="prompt">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</p>
       <p class="answers">Again, I will be much more kinder to myself, and cultivate a more positive outlook on my progress despite of where I am. </p>

       <p class="prompt">Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</p>
       <p class="answers"><a href ="https://www.mindsethealth.com/matter/growth-vs-fixed-mindset#:~:text=A%20growth%20mindset%20simply%20means,back'%20by%20increasing%20motivational%20effort.">Article on Growth vs. Fixed mindset</a></p>

       <p class="prompt">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</p>
       <p class="answers">This will shape my mindset greatly and will cultivate a better approach into learning. I will do this by being more kinder to myself, 
        believing that I can overcome imposter syndrome and get to a place where I can be confident in coding. </p>
